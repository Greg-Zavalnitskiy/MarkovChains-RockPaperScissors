# Markov Chain Rock Paper Scissors

This is an interactive rock paper scissors game that implements a Markov Chain Model. To predict the player's future choices, there is a probability matrix that keeps track of choices that come after previous states. As the game goes on the probability matrix will continue to evolve according to the player's pattern of choices.
